        of Service.
        <br>
        This Site is targeted at and intended for visitors residing in the United States. Given the global nature of the
        Internet, however, the Site may be accessed by visitors residing outside of the United States. We make no
        representations or warranties that the Site is appropriate or available for use in countries outside of the
        United States. Visitors who choose to access the Site from outside of the United States do so at their own

        such access.
        <br>

        The laws applicable to the interpretation of this Agreement shall be the laws of the State of California and
        applicable federal law, without regard to any conflict of law provisions. You agree to submit to the personal
        and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the county of Los Angeles, California.
        You also agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to your use of the Site or the
        Services, that you and we will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly
        between the parties. You agree that if the matter remains unsettled for forty-five (45) days after notification
        (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, all parties shall join in mediation services in
        Los Angeles, California with a mutually agreed mediator to settle the dispute. Should you file any arbitration
        claims, administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then
        you will not be entitled to recover attorney's fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.
        <br>
        14. Assignment.
